# Code of Conduct

Our community is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. We expect all participants to be respectful, considerate, and collaborative.

Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences. Be considerate in your communication. Be collaborative and work together constructively. Focus on what is best for the community. Show empathy towards other community members.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, discrimination, trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, public or private harassment, publishing others' private information without permission, and other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated. We are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
